👔: I am currently studying an MPhil specializing in Financial Technology at UCT.

🎯: Research interests are spatial statistics, supervised learning and personal and digital finance. 

🎨: On my spare time, I love hiking 🥾 and then a glass of Devil's Peak beer 🍺 with friends. My favorite is Silvermine Nature Reserve.
